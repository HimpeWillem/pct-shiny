                <b>Welcome to the National Propensity to Cycle Tool (NPCT) Prototype.</b>
              </p>
              The NPCT provides evidence to guide cycling investment in England.
              The map shows cycling levels at the small area level and between
              areas based on 2011 Census commuting data. It also shows what
              spatial distribution of cycling might be expected as cycling
              increases.<br />
              The cycling trips can be allocated to the road network. The purpose
              of the route allocation is to see on which routes the most
              provision might be necessary as cycling grows rather than to show
              where people currently cycle. We recognise that many people
              currently do not chose the fastest route but for cycling to achieve
              its potential will require direct routes on which people feel
              safe.<br />
              Users can select from different scenarios to choose the overall
              cycling scenario and can then see what this might mean for each
              area. The model estimates cycling potential based upon trip
              distances and hilliness. Therefore, it highlights the greatest
              unmet potential in areas that currently have lots of short trips in
              relatively flat areas but where people are not currently
              cycling.<br />
              At the moment the model just shows commuting main mode trips but
              additional layers will be added to future versions
