This is the online home of the (prototype) open source transport planning system, the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), released under the AGP Licence and free to use, copy and modify for use in new contexts. 
The PCT is created using the best data available and with transparent methods, however, we can accept no liability, included but not limited to loss or damages.
The PCT was created by an academic team from CEDAR (University of Cambridge), ITS/CDRC (University of Leeds), and the University of Westminster , and YouthinMind. The work was initially funded by the Department for Transport (DfT) to create a Propensity to  Cycle Tool  for England. The PCT framework and software was developed in a way that  allows it to be used in other countries and cities.The PCT will be officially launched for England in July 2016. Further information on the project can be found at the University of Cambridge, the University of Leeds and the European Cycling Federation. The PCT academic project members include:
• James Woodcock
• Robin Lovelace
• Rachel Aldred
• Anna Goodman
• Alvaro Ullrich
• Ali Abbas
• Nikolai Berkoff
The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) was designed to assist transport planners and policy makers to prioritise investments and interventions to promote cycling. The key question that the PCT answers is "where is cycling currently common and where does cycling have the greatest potential to grow?"
The PCT can be used at different scales.
First the PCT is a strategic planning tool. Different visons of the future are represented through the various scenarios of change, including the government's target to double cycling in a decade to the more ambitious 'Go Dutch' scenario whereby Dutch propensities to cycle (allowing for English hilliness and trip distances) are reached in England. By showing what the rate of cycling could feasibly look like in different parts of cities and regions, and illustrating the associated increase in cycle use on the road network, the PCT should inform policies that seek a wider shift towards sustainable transport more generally.
Second, the PCT can also be used at a smaller scale. The scenario level of commuter cycling along a particular road can be used to estimate future mode share for cycling on that corridor. This can be compared with current allocation of space to different modes, and used to consider re-allocation from less sustainable modes to cater for cycling growth. In other cases, low current or potential flows may indicate a barrier, such as a major road or rail line, causing severance and lengthening trips. This could be addressed through new infrastructure such as a pedestrian and cycle bridge. 
Central both to strategic and smaller-scale use is the question of where to prioritise high quality cycling infrastructure of sufficient capacity for a planned growth in cycling.
In summary the PCT is a planning support system to improve cycling provision at many levels from regions to specific points on the road network. For further work on the approach, please see the academic paper: The Propensity to Cycle Tool: An open source online system for sustainable transport planning.
